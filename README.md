# lab3

This lab was created so we could learn how to make an interactive web map. Although the only interaction is clicking on an airplane icon and a popup will apepear.

# Primary functions

This map was created to show the airports in the U.S.
It was made so that when you click on an airport icon it will have a small pop up with Y or N to tell you if the airport has a cell tower. The different shades of colors represents how many airports are in one state depending on the scale I chose which is shown in the legend.

# Libraries

We use different libraries in here to help certain styles. For example we used a font library to change the font from Times New Romane. We also used icons from font awesome. Also I used a basemap from leaflet from the leaflet website. 

# Data sources

We have the us-states.geojson file and the airports.geojson file
